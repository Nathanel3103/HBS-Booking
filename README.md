This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

chatbot logic (analyze these suggestions ( Webhook URL Validation Caveat
js
Copy
Edit
const url = process.env.WEBHOOK_URL;
Twilio validates against the full webhook URL. If you're deploying to environments like Vercel where the URL might change (e.g., staging, dev), make sure WEBHOOK_URL is always accurate. Otherwise, signature validation may fail.(From the image (which includes a WhatsApp conversation), it looks like a user might be testing the chatbot. If you want me to extract and match the conversation against the logic in the webhook/helper functions (e.g., to debug a message that wasn‚Äôt understood), I can do that.

Want Help With Any of This?
Debugging a specific issue (e.g., messages not responding correctly)?

Extending the logic (e.g., storing session state in MongoDB)?)))


Awesome! Just to clarify before we dive in ‚Äî what specifically would you like help with first?

Here are a few focused options based on your current setup:

üß† Add Stateful Conversations
Store user's progress (e.g., selected service, date, time, etc.) in MongoDB to guide them through booking step-by-step.

üêõ Debug WhatsApp Message Issues
If something isn‚Äôt working (e.g., chatbot not replying, wrong response sent), I can check logic or troubleshoot with the image you sent.

üß∞ Improve handleMessage() Logic
Make responses smarter ‚Äî for example, detect when a user enters a date vs. when they‚Äôre picking a doctor, etc.

üì¶ Connect WhatsApp to MongoDB Session
Save conversations, appointments, or user sessions directly to your MongoDB Atlas database.

üìä Add Appointment Summary + Management
Let users view, cancel, or reschedule their appointments through WhatsApp.

Just reply with the number or the topic you're most interested in ‚Äî or if it's something else entirely, I'm down for that too!
